# Changelog

All notable changes to Plumbline are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Consumers should pin a released tag (e.g. `amos-labs/plumbline@v1`) rather than
`@master` — see [Pinning a version](README.md#pinning-a-version) in the README.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **npm and npx package binaries execute correctly through `node_modules/.bin`
  symlinks on Node 24.** The CLI now compares canonical real paths when deciding
  whether its ESM entry module was invoked directly. Previously, Node preserved
  the npm symlink in `process.argv[1]` while resolving `import.meta.url` to the
  target, so normal commands could exit successfully without running. An
  end-to-end regression now launches the compiled CLI through a real symlink.

### Security

- **npm lifecycle scripts are disabled for Plumbline installs.** The repository
  now sets `ignore-scripts=true`, reducing the cross-repository exposure of an
  npx-invoked governance tool to install-hook supply-chain attacks while keeping
  the esbuild optional binary and the complete test suite working.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-02

The CLI is reachable again, and an auto-merge no longer swallows your deploy.

### Fixed

- **`npx` could not run the CLI at all (silently).** Every documented invocation
  has the form `npx -y "git+https://github.com/amos-labs/plumbline#<tag>" <cmd>`.
  npx resolves `<spec> <args>` to the bin entry whose name matches the **package
  name** — and the package is `plumbline`, while `bin` declared only `plumb` and
  `proofgate`. No bin matched, npx could not choose one, and the command **exited
  0 with no output on either stream**. The worst failure mode a quick start can
  have: indistinguishable from success.

  This is why #69 kept resurfacing after it was fixed. `plumb diff-hash` prints
  the hermetic hash, the legacy hash, and a plain-text note naming the divergence
  — a complete self-diagnosis nobody could reach. Downstream on
  `NuvolaNetworks/cuspr`, contributors fell back to hand-computing `diff_sha256`
  with a bare `git diff | shasum`, which cannot reproduce the hermetic binding;
  that produced four consecutive REWORK verdicts (#416–#419) and a wrong
  root-cause diagnosis before anyone ran the CLI from a local checkout.

  `plumbline` is now a bin alias; `plumb` and `proofgate` are unchanged.

- **`lifecycle: auto_merge` merged PRs that never deployed.** Auto-merge is
  enabled via GitHub's `enablePullRequestAutoMerge`, and GitHub performs the
  merge on behalf of whoever enabled it. We enabled it with the default
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub's recursion guard suppresses **every** workflow
  trigger for `GITHUB_TOKEN` actions — so the merge commit fired no `push`
  event, any CD workflow on `push: [main]` never ran, and the commit sat on the
  default branch looking shipped.

  Measured on cuspr: four auto-merged PRs, **zero** workflow runs of any kind on
  their merge commits. That repo had already added a ten-minute cron safety net,
  but GitHub throttles schedules on busy shared runners — all 12 most recent
  deploy runs were `event: schedule` at a 1–3 **hour** cadence, never `push`. An
  earlier incident there held 29 commits for 5 days.

  New `merge-token` action input (env `PLUMBLINE_MERGE_TOKEN`): set it to a PAT
  or App token and the merge is attributed to a real identity, so `push` behaves
  normally. It still falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` — but the gate now **says so**,
  in the PR comment and the job log, instead of merging silently into a void.

- **The gate misreported its own version.** `PLUMBLINE_VERSION` in `src/shape.ts`
  was a hand-maintained literal with a "keep in sync with `package.json`" comment
  above it, and it had already drifted: v0.7.2 shipped reporting
  `gate=plumbline 0.7.1` in every diff-mismatch message. That is exactly the
  message someone reads while debugging a version skew, so the stale value
  actively misled the one investigation it exists to serve. It is now derived
  from `package.json` and cannot drift again.

### Note

v0.7.2 shipped without a changelog entry; its contents are described in #76.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-30

The diff binding no longer depends on local git config.

### Fixed

- **The receipt binding is now hermetic (#69).** `diff_sha256` was a sha256 over
  raw `git diff` output, and that output is **not** a pure function of the tree —
  it varies with the stamping machine's git configuration. A different
  `core.abbrev`, `diff.algorithm`, `diff.context`, `diff.noprefix`, … produced a
  hash the gate could not reproduce, so a PR whose content was byte-identical was
  failed with `diff_sha256 mismatch` and routed to REWORK. Local pre-flight
  passed, CI failed, and it presented as a generic "receipt fumble".

  Measured on `NuvolaNetworks/cuspr`: the stamped hash `a973ec40…` is exactly what
  `core.abbrev=7` yields for a tree the gate hashed as `401688b5…`. One config
  knob blocked six PRs across two days and cost two REWORK loops to diagnose.
  The earlier hypothesis in #69 — that the CLI's diff command changed between the
  tag and a dev build — was wrong: `src/shape.ts` is byte-identical at `v0.7.0`
  and `master`. The variable was always the environment, never the version.

  The binding diff now neutralises user/system config via env, pins every
  output-affecting knob with `-c` (which outranks repo-local `.git/config`), and
  prints full blob SHAs so `core.abbrev` cannot matter at all. Both the pinned
  2-dot and legacy 3-dot paths are normalised, preserving their equality — and the
  verdict cache key that rests on it.

### Added

- **`diff_algo` in the receipt.** Records which normalisation `diff_sha256` was
  computed under, so the gate verifies with the *same* algorithm instead of
  assuming. `plumb receipt --write` / `stamp` / `generate` stamp `v1`.
  **Back-compat:** a receipt without `diff_algo` is accepted against either the
  hermetic or the legacy hash, so hardening the binding does not itself become a
  fleet-wide REWORK event. A legacy-only match passes with a warning to re-stamp.
- **`plumb diff-hash`** — prints the authoritative binding for a base (and the
  legacy value when local config makes them differ). A bare `git diff | sha256`
  never reproduced the binding; this does.
- The diff-mismatch error now names the algorithm and the gate version, and says
  outright that a bare `git diff` will not reproduce the hash — so a config skew
  is diagnosable in one read rather than two REWORK loops.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-18

The proof-carrying code-lifecycle + gate-precision release. Motivation: a
non-coder opens PRs through an MCP `propose_code_change` verb; every PR
dead-ended in REWORK for "no receipt", and separately the gate (a) marked almost
everything `self_modifying` (REVIEW always-on, auto-merge never fired) and (b)
filed too many follow-up issues per PR. Four changes, all in service of "the gate
flags only what genuinely warrants it."

### Added
- **`plumb receipt generate`** — auto-synthesize a conformant, HONEST receipt for
  a machine-authored (MCP) change. `validation_plan` references the repo's CI as
  `ci_covered: true` (evidence `skipped` with a reason) — it does NOT fabricate a
  local test run, truthfully recording that validation is deferred to CI.
  `self_modifying` is auto-detected from the repo's `protected_paths`;
  `diff_sha256`/`changed_files`/`base_sha` come from the real `base..HEAD` diff.
  Idempotent. Makes MCP PRs proof-carrying by construction: green-CI +
  non-protected → PASS; protected surface → REVIEW.
- **`lifecycle: "review" | "auto_merge"`** (policy, per repo). `review` (default)
  = the gate judges, a human merges (today's behavior). `auto_merge` = on a
  terminal PASS, plumbline enables GitHub-native auto-merge on the PR
  (`enablePullRequestAutoMerge`) so GitHub merges once all required checks are
  green — Plumbline judges, GitHub merges (no custom merge loop). REVIEW/REWORK
  and a phase-1 (quality) pass never auto-merge.
- **`plumb followups close --pr <n>`** — close a merged PR's consolidated
  follow-up issue (run on `pull_request: closed`).
- **`follow_ups` policy block** — `min_confidence` (filing threshold),
  `consolidate` (one issue per PR), `close_on_merge`.

### Changed
- **Protected paths: conservative documented default.** When `protected_paths` is
  unset, the gate now protects a conservative set of genuinely high-consequence
  surfaces only — the gate's own files, CI workflows, auth/authz, migrations,
  money/billing, and the proof surface — NOT broad code trees (`src/**`,
  `src/mcp/**`). Over-broad protection was marking almost every PR
  `self_modifying`, pinning REVIEW always-on and defeating auto-merge. Setting
  `protected_paths` in policy REPLACES the default; documented how to
  narrow/widen per repo.
- **Follow-up flood fix.** Follow-ups now (1) file only above a confidence bar
  (`follow_ups.min_confidence`, default 0.8) — below it, findings stay in the PR
  comment and are NOT filed; (2) consolidate into ONE "Follow-ups for #<PR>"
  issue with a checklist, updated in place on re-runs (deduped by PR), instead of
  N separate issues; (3) auto-close on merge. Legacy one-issue-per-finding
  behavior available via `follow_ups.consolidate: false`.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-17

REVIEW is a TERMINAL verdict only. The 2026-07-17 incident: the staged gate ran
`plumb run --phase quality` (phase 1) on a PR touching a protected surface. Phase
1 did shape PASS, ci-evidence SKIPPED (correct), semantic review = **review**
(human sign-off, no rework) — then **exited 1 and published a blocking
"REVIEW — awaiting human approval" check-run**, treating REVIEW as a phase-1
failure. That is wrong: there was no rework, so phase 1 should have been GREEN
and let the tests run. The cascade: phase 1 "failed" ⇒ the test jobs were SKIPPED
(the `needs:` chain) ⇒ phase 3 (`--phase verify`) saw the required checks as
`conclusion=skipped` ⇒ ci-evidence FAIL ⇒ a **second, contradictory REWORK**.
One PR got both REVIEW and REWORK.

### Fixed
- **Phase 1 (quality) no longer blocks on REVIEW.** `--phase quality`'s only
  blocking job is REWORK detection (a shape failure, or a semantic verdict of
  `rework` — an agent-fixable, blocking+agent finding). A semantic outcome of
  `review` (a protected-surface change, a blocking+human finding, or a
  confidence-floor downgrade — none of which are rework) is now remapped to a
  **non-blocking pass**: exit 0, a PASS-style check-run, and no `REVIEW —
  awaiting human approval` check-run. The tests proceed, and the terminal REVIEW
  is emitted by phase 2 (verify) as designed.

### Model (unchanged, now enforced correctly)
- **REWORK** = agent-fixable (shape failure / semantic `rework`). The ONLY thing
  that blocks phase 1 (quality).
- **REVIEW** = human sign-off required. A **terminal verdict only**, produced in
  `--phase verify` (and `--phase full`), AFTER ci-evidence. Never in
  `--phase quality`.
- **PASS** = green.

### Handoff / consumer impact
- **None.** No cross-job state, no handoff file, no template change. Phase 2
  (verify) already re-runs the full shape + semantic review on the final diff
  (deduped by the `diff_sha256` review cache — no extra LLM call when the diff
  is unchanged), so it re-derives whether REVIEW is warranted natively — from
  both the protected-path/policy floor AND the semantic model's blocking+human
  findings. `templates/workflow-staged.yml` and consumers (e.g. amos-platform's
  staged `deploy.yml`) need no change.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-16

Infra-error state. During a GitHub outage the gate's API calls got a
`503 Unicorn` page: the **ci-evidence** step reported "could not verify CI
checks: …503…" and that routed to a hard **REWORK** ("agent's turn — do not
merge") on a PR whose code was fine. The gate conflated "I couldn't evaluate
because of a transient upstream failure" with "the code needs rework" — which
trains humans to merge past REWORKs and defeats the gate. v0.6.1 makes the gate
distinguish *could-not-evaluate* from a real verdict.

### Added
- **`INDETERMINATE` (infra_error) terminal outcome.** A NEW state distinct from
  PASS / REWORK / REVIEW, emitted only when a GitHub API call the gate needs
  fails transiently and survives every retry. It:
  - surfaces with a distinct 🔌 icon, check-run name
    (`Plumbline: INDETERMINATE — could not evaluate (GitHub infra error)`,
    conclusion `action_required`), and a PR comment / log that state plainly:
    *"⚠️ Gate could not evaluate — GitHub infrastructure error (e.g. 503/timeout),
    NOT a code verdict… neither a REWORK nor an approval… Re-run the gate when
    GitHub recovers."*
  - **blocks auto-merge** (non-zero exit — we could not verify) without reading
    as an agent-fix REWORK or a green PASS.
  - is trivially **re-runnable**: a fresh gate run once GitHub is healthy
    produces a real verdict.
- **Bounded retry with exponential backoff + jitter** on the GitHub API calls
  the gate makes (`githubFetch`, wrapping the PR + check-runs fetches used by
  ci-evidence). Transient failures are retried (4 attempts, ~<30s worst case):
  HTTP 5xx (500/502/503/504), 429, and network errors (ECONNRESET/ETIMEDOUT/
  socket hangups). Real 4xx auth/permission errors (401/403/404) are **never**
  retried.

### Unchanged
- Phase logic (v0.6.0) and the shape/semantic/ci-evidence gate LOGIC are
  untouched. When GitHub is healthy, every existing outcome behaves exactly as
  before; INDETERMINATE only appears on a sustained transient upstream failure.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-16

Phased gate (fail-cheap-first). The monolithic gate ran the full (often ~30-min)
test suite AND the semantic review on every push, so an agent fixing a REWORK
paid the whole suite again — the slowness that makes people route around the
gate. v0.6.0 splits the CI gate into cheap-then-expensive stages so the agent's
iterate loop spins against the ~2-min shape+semantic phase, and the test suite
fires ONCE, only after the code is known-solid.

### Added
- **`plumb run --phase quality|verify|full` (#58).** The CI gate can now run in
  stages:
  - `quality` (phase 1) — shape + semantic review only. **ci-evidence is
    SKIPPED** (tests haven't run yet). A REWORK fails the job (non-zero exit) so
    the workflow's `needs:` chain blocks phase 2; a clean phase-1 exits 0 so
    phase 2 proceeds. The verdict/reason wording states LOUDLY that tests were
    SKIPPED (not "passed") — a clean phase 1 is not a terminal PASS.
  - `verify` (phase 2) — the ci-evidence gate (tests present + passing, read
    from the real CI check-run) + the terminal PASS / REWORK / REVIEW verdict.
    Assumes phase 1 already passed.
  - `full` (**default**) — today's all-in-one gate, unchanged.
- **Staged workflow example** at `templates/workflow-staged.yml` — the
  `quality → tests (needs: [quality]) → gate (needs: [tests])` three-job
  structure, with `checks: write` + `issues: write` on the gate job.
- **`phase` input on the composite Action** (`action.yml`), threaded to
  `plumb run --phase`. Defaults to `full`.

### Changed
- The gate receipt/reasons now record **which phase produced the verdict**
  (phase 1 = shape/semantic; phase 2 = ci-evidence), so a phase-1 result is
  never mistaken for a terminal one.

### Compatibility
- **Fully back-compatible.** `--phase full` is the default and is byte-for-byte
  today's behavior; the shape / semantic / ci-evidence gate LOGIC is unchanged
  (only *when* each runs, plus the phase flag and verdict wording). Consumers
  still on the single-run `templates/workflow.yml` (Cuspr / nuvola /
  amos-platform) keep working with no change. No receipt-schema change.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-16

Gate-trust: make the three verdicts unmistakable end-to-end, tighten REWORK vs
REVIEW routing, and stop losing good-but-optional findings. Folds #55 (local
shape parity #53 + unambiguous REWORK vs REVIEW #54) and #57 (verdict
classification #56 + `check` first-run ergonomics #49 + doc refresh #48).

### Added
- **Distinct per-verdict surfaces (#54).** A single verdict-presentation table
  (`src/verdict.ts`) is now the sole source of how every surface renders a
  verdict, so REWORK and REVIEW can never again collapse into one identical red
  "failure" check. The CI gate publishes a **per-verdict check-run** with a
  distinct NAME and CONCLUSION:
  - `Plumbline: PASS` — `success`
  - `Plumbline: REWORK — blocked, do not merge` — `failure` (agent's turn)
  - `Plumbline: REVIEW — awaiting human approval` — `action_required` (human's
    turn; renders distinctly from a plain failure in the PR UI)

  The PR-comment title and the Checks-tab annotation are derived from the same
  table. Motivated by amos-platform#211, where a REWORK was merged by accident
  because it looked identical to a REVIEW.
- **Materiality axis + 3-way classification (#56).** Findings gain a
  `material / optional / noise` axis on top of `class` + `actor`. Routing is now
  deterministic and sequential: any **material, agent-fixable** finding ⇒
  **REWORK** (even on a protected / `self_modifying` surface); **REVIEW** is
  emitted only when no agent-fixable items remain (a pure human decision list);
  **noise** is dropped.
- **Optional-but-good findings become tracked follow-up issues (#56).**
  Optional findings are no longer silently skipped as advisory notes — the gate
  **files a deduped follow-up GitHub issue** for each (deduplicated by a stable
  per-finding fingerprint via issue search). Best-effort: filing never throws,
  so a repo without `issues: write` degrades gracefully rather than failing the
  gate. Requires `issues: write` (and `checks: write` for the per-verdict
  check-run) on the gate job.
- **`plumb check` finds an untracked receipt (#49).** Local pre-flight
  auto-discovery now consults `git status --porcelain`, so `plumb check` works
  before `git add`. LOCAL only — CI stays diff-based.

### Changed
- **Doc refresh (#48).** README Status updated to the v0.4.x/v0.5 shape; both
  AGENTS.md TL;DRs rewritten around the single idempotent `receipt --write` step.

### Compatibility
- **Back-compatible for consumers.** The new check-runs and follow-up-issue
  filing require `checks: write` / `issues: write` on the gate job; without them
  the gate degrades gracefully (no per-verdict check-run / no follow-up issues)
  rather than failing. No receipt-schema or gate exit-code change.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **`base_sha` receipt field — the diff base is now PINNED, killing the
  recurring `diff_sha256` staleness REWORKs.** The binding hash is
  `sha256(git diff <base>...HEAD)`, a 3-dot diff whose base is the *merge-base*
  of the branch and `origin/main`. In a high-merge-velocity repo that merge-base
  **drifts**: an agent stamps against a slightly stale local `origin/main` while
  the gate fetches a fresher one → a different merge-base → a different hash →
  a **spurious REWORK on a content-clean PR.** The fix: `plumb receipt --write`
  (and `stamp` / `new`) now record `base_sha` = the exact merge-base commit and
  compute `diff_sha256` as the **2-dot** `git diff <base_sha>..HEAD` (byte-for-byte
  identical to the old 3-dot, but deterministic — it names the base commit
  instead of re-deriving it). The gate verifies against that pinned commit and
  does **not** re-derive the base from the live `origin/main`, so concurrent
  merges / a stale local main / the synthetic GitHub merge-ref checkout can no
  longer move the hash.

### Security
- **Pinned-base ancestry backstop.** The gate asserts `base_sha` is a real
  ancestor of the default branch (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`). A forged or
  unrelated-history base — which could otherwise hide changes by diffing against
  the wrong commit — is **rejected**. The receipt still attests the branch's true
  diff off a legitimate fork point.

### Compatibility
- **Fully back-compatible.** A receipt *without* `base_sha` (old-format receipts,
  consumers still on `@v0.3.0`) verifies via the original `origin/main`-derived
  3-dot path — nothing breaks during rollout. `base_sha` is optional in the
  schema. Consumer repos can re-pin to `@v0.4.0` at their own pace.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### ⚠️ BREAKING
- **The gate now fails CLOSED when the semantic review is required but can't run
  (trust-integrity).** Previously, if the review provider was absent or
  unreachable (no API key, provider/API error, timeout) the gate could fall back
  to the deterministic shape checks alone and still PASS. A proof-carrying trust
  gate that fails *open* is a bug in the thesis. Now, when the semantic review is
  required and cannot run, the verdict is a **BLOCK** (`review`) with a loud
  *"semantic review unavailable — failing closed"* capsule — never a silent
  shape-only pass. Governed by the new `require_semantic_review` policy flag,
  which **defaults to `true`.**

  **Why this is BREAKING:** any repo that was (perhaps unknowingly) relying on
  the old shape-only fallback with **no provider key configured** will now see
  the `plumbline` check go **red (BLOCK)** instead of passing. Repos that already
  provide a provider key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `PLUMBLINE_API_KEY`) are
  unaffected — the review runs exactly as before.

  **Migration.** Either (a) add a provider key (recommended — you get the
  semantic half of the gate you were missing), or (b) for a **deliberately
  offline / self-hosted / air-gapped** repo, set
  `"require_semantic_review": false` in `policy.json` — the shape gate may then
  PASS, but the verdict and PR comment state *loudly* that the semantic review
  did not run (never a silent pass). This is exactly why consumers should pin a
  released tag, not `@master`: a breaking change like this arrives as a
  deliberate, CHANGELOG-noted upgrade rather than shifting under a floating ref.

### Added
- **`require_semantic_review` policy flag** (default `true`) — the fail-closed
  switch above. See "How it works" and the cost-controls section in the README.
  Enforced at both unavailability points (provider construction with no key, and
  a runtime provider-call failure — API error / network / timeout), via a single
  shared `resolveUnavailableVerdict` decision so the two paths cannot drift.
- **README honesty note on what "proof" means.** "Proof-carrying" here =
  diff-binding (`diff_sha256`) + CI evidence corroboration + a *probabilistic*
  semantic review, gated on that review actually having run — **not** a
  cryptographic attestation of the agent's work. Receipt signing is planned, not
  shipped; the README keeps that distinction explicit.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **Marketplace listing metadata (`action.yml`).** `name` → `Plumbline Gate`
  (the bare "Plumbline" is taken on the Marketplace) and `description` shortened
  to under GitHub's 125-char listing limit. No behavior change.


## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **Launch polish for the GitHub Marketplace (#43).** Marketplace metadata
  (`action.yml` name → `Plumbline`, branding `target`/`blue`), a "Why Plumbline"
  section, the brand kit under `assets/`, a sample failure-capsule in the README,
  and a documented backward-compatibility note for the retained `proofgate`
  aliases (`.proofgate/` dirs, `PROOFGATE_*` env vars, the `proofgate` CLI alias).

- **Turn-based verdicts — the verdict now encodes whose turn it is, exclusively (#41).**
  The verdict is derived mechanically from classified findings, not taken from the model.
  ANY blocking + agent-fixable finding ⇒ **REWORK** (the agent's turn), *even on a
  protected / `self_modifying` path* — the protected floor only forbids auto-APPROVE, it
  no longer skips the agent iteration phase. **REVIEW** is emitted only when the
  blocking + agent set is empty, so a REVIEW is by construction a pure human decision list
  with **zero 🤖 items**. Replaces the old "worst-trigger" behavior where a REVIEW could
  still hand the agent homework.

### Added
- **Blocking vs advisory findings (#41).** Findings are classified on two axes:
  `class` (`blocking` = a defect that gates, `advisory` = a "consider…"/style/nice-to-have)
  and `actor` (`agent` / `human`). Only blocking findings affect the verdict; advisory
  notes render in their own 💡 section, are recorded in the capsule, and never block a merge.
- **Convergent (delta) re-review with a round cap (#41).** On re-review the prompt receives
  the prior capsule + the fix commits and reviews ONLY the new/changed hunks for regressions
  — it must not raise fresh findings on unchanged code it already reviewed. After 2 rework
  rounds a convergence cap engages: only regressions in the fix commits may block; anything
  else escalates to REVIEW under a "gate did not converge — human decides" banner, so the
  loop is always bounded (no unbounded nitpick loops).
- **`plumb check` no longer prints a bare gate verdict.** The local pre-flight
  runs only the shape floor + `diff_sha256` (the LLM semantic review runs in CI),
  so it now prints a scoped `shape pre-flight: PASS/FAIL` banner instead of
  `APPROVE`/`REVIEW`/`REWORK` — a shape-PASS locally can still be `REVIEW`/`REWORK`
  in CI, and the banner says so. (#39)

### Added
- **`plumb check --review`** — full local parity: runs the semantic review too and
  prints the real verdict (same code path as the CI gate). Requires a provider key
  (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `PLUMBLINE_API_KEY`); with no key it degrades to the
  shape-only pre-flight and says so explicitly (never claims a verdict it didn't
  compute). (#39)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-08

### Security / Hardening
- **`setup-protection` no longer clobbers existing branch protection.** It now
  GETs the current protection first and PRESERVES existing
  `required_pull_request_reviews` (required reviewers, code-owner review) and
  `restrictions` (push allow-lists) — it only ever ADDS the required status
  checks + enables auto-merge, and never nulls those settings. If it can't read
  the current protection (so preserving isn't possible), it refuses to write
  unless `--force` is passed. CLI help + AGENTS.md document exactly what changes.
- **OpenAI-compatible provider never falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.**
  Sending an Anthropic key to a third-party/self-hosted OpenAI endpoint would
  leak that credential; the provider now requires an explicit
  `PLUMBLINE_API_KEY` (or `PROOFGATE_API_KEY`) and errors clearly when missing.
- **Temperature is omitted by default** (was always sent as `0`). Some Anthropic
  models reject an explicit `temperature`; the gate now sends none unless
  `review_temperature` (policy) or `PLUMBLINE_TEMPERATURE` (env) is set —
  keeping determinism where the model supports it without breaking those models.
- **Redundant protected-path / `self_modifying` floor before auto-approve.** The
  CLI re-checks the floor (from the ACTUAL diff, not just the receipt's
  self-report) on the review-skip path, so a bug in `shouldSkipReview` can never
  auto-approve a protected change.
- **Cache verdicts are validated against the real diff.** Before serving a
  cached verdict, the CLI recomputes the diff hash and confirms it matches
  `receipt.diff_sha256`; a mismatch is a cache miss (live review) — so a
  stale/wrong hash can't serve a mismatched cached verdict.
- **Robust poll-wait self-detection** in the scaffolded workflow. Self is now
  identified by this workflow run's id (embedded in the check-run's
  `details_url`), not a name substring — surviving a job rename and never
  self-waiting to timeout when another check merely contains "plumbline".

### Added
- **Provider abstraction for the semantic review (#25).** The review LLM call is
  now behind a small `ReviewProvider` interface. Anthropic stays the default with
  its env unchanged (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `PLUMBLINE_MODEL`/`PROOFGATE_MODEL`); any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Together, Groq, vLLM, Ollama,
  self-hosted, …) is selectable via `PLUMBLINE_PROVIDER=openai` + `PLUMBLINE_API_BASE`
  + `PLUMBLINE_API_KEY`, or `policy.review_provider` / `policy.review_api_base`. The
  prompt and the `approve`/`rework`/`review` verdict schema are provider-independent.
- **LLM cost + determinism controls (#26), all opt-in — defaults preserve today's
  behavior (review always runs).**
  - `skip_review` — pass docs-only / config-only / below-size-threshold diffs on the
    shape gate alone. **Hard floor:** `self_modifying` / `protected_paths` changes are
    never skipped.
  - `review_cache` — reuse a prior verdict for an identical diff (keyed by
    `diff_sha256`, scoped to provider + model + prompt version).
  - `budget` — optional cheaper-model tier (`use_cheap_model` / `cheap_model`) and an
    informational per-PR spend cap (`max_usd_per_pr`).
  - Determinism: `review_temperature` is optional (see Security / Hardening — now
    omitted by default rather than pinned to `0`); the verdict records `audit`
    metadata (provider, model, prompt version, temperature, cache hit) for
    reproducibility.
- **Batteries-included `plumb init` + `plumb setup-protection`** (#22) — two-layer,
  correct-by-default governed-CI setup so a new repo can't land the subtly-wrong
  configurations that silently defeat the gate.
  - **Language-agnostic core:** the scaffolded gate workflow now ships WITH the
    **ci-evidence poll-wait** wired (waits for the repo's CI check-runs to reach a
    terminal conclusion before the gate evaluates, so it never races CI; timeout via
    the `PLUMBLINE_POLL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` repo/org variable, default 900s). AGENTS.md
    gains the database-migration conventions (never edit an applied migration,
    full-timestamp versions, the guard rejects a version ≤ base max).
  - **`plumb setup-protection --repo owner/name`** (and `plumb init --protect`) —
    via the GitHub API, makes the `plumbline` gate + the repo's CI checks REQUIRED on
    the default branch (`strict:false`) and enables auto-merge — the "blocking +
    auto-merge on all green" shape. Idempotent; prints what it changed; needs a
    repo-admin token.
  - **Stack presets** (auto-detected or `--stack`; `--no-stack` to skip). **`rust-sqlx`**
    (Cargo.toml + `migrations/` + sqlx): scaffolds a migration-version-collision guard
    (`plumb migration-guard`), rust-cache + parallelized (no `needs:` chain) test jobs,
    the policy's `ci_evidence_checks` pre-bound to those jobs, and — if a Dockerfile is
    present — a cargo-chef layering + `cache-to mode=max` hint. Everything is an
    overridable plain file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

First tagged release with a changelog and a release process. No behavioral change
from the code merged after `v0` — this release exists so consumers can pin a real
version and pick up the accumulated wording and ergonomics changes deliberately,
instead of floating on `@master` or being stuck behind the `v0` tag.

Everything below is the state of the gate as of this release. It is grouped by area
rather than by the commit that introduced it, because `v0` was the only prior tag.

### Added
- **`propose` intake.** Scaffolds a GitHub issue and an OpenSpec-compatible
  `openspec/changes/<slug>/` contract (proposal + specs + tasks), born linked: the
  issue number is written into the proposal's `task_id` front-matter and the issue
  body carries the contract path. `--lite` opens a plain issue with no contract folder.
- **`receipt --write` / `receipt --check`.** One idempotent command computes all
  mechanical receipt fields — `diff_sha256`, `changed_files`, and `self_modifying`
  (derived from the policy's `protected_paths`) — and refreshes them after rebases
  while preserving author-written judgment fields. `receipt --check` exits non-zero
  when the mechanical half is stale (small enough for a pre-push hook).
- **`archive`.** Applies a change's ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED spec deltas to
  `openspec/specs/` and moves the change to `openspec/changes/archive/`. Refuses
  unless the change's receipt passes the gate (`--force` overrides, loudly).
- **Per-PR receipts.** Receipts live at `.plumbline/receipts/<task_id>.json`, one file
  per PR, so parallel/autonomous agents never conflict on a shared `receipt.json`. The
  gate auto-discovers the receipt added in the PR's diff.
- **Evidence integrity (`ci_evidence_checks`).** The gate corroborates a receipt's
  claimed execution evidence against the real conclusion of the named CI check-runs,
  so a receipt can't assert a green test suite the CI never ran. Includes a poll-wait
  so the gate waits for the corroborating check to finish before reading it.
- **Attempt history.** Reruns archive prior verdicts (newest first, capped at 5) in a
  collapsed section of the single in-place PR comment, so a multi-round fix keeps its
  full trajectory in one place instead of erasing it.
- **Tunable strictness.** `strictness` (`strict` / `lenient`) and per-check
  `check_severity` in `policy.json`, with a hard floor — `schema`, `diff_integrity`,
  and `protected_paths` can never be downgraded.
- **`human_review_level` dial** (`low` / `balanced` / `high`) tunes only how
  aggressively work routes to humans; it never lowers the hard floor (protected paths
  and `self_modifying` always need a human).
- **Failure capsule split.** Every capsule separates `agent_actions` (fixes an agent
  can do now) from `human_actions` (decisions only a human can make); a `review`
  verdict still lists `agent_actions` so agent-fixable work proceeds in parallel.
- **Self-hosting.** The repo runs its own gate on every PR (`uses: ./`), so
  enforcement changes are exercised by the PR that makes them.
- **Local pre-flight** (`stamp`, `check`) — same shape + diff checks as CI, runnable
  before push.
- **Discoverable receipt schema** (`plumb schema`) and an inline `_help` block in the
  scaffolded receipt.
- **Agent-installable `init`** — scaffolds `.github/workflows`, `.plumbline/`, and an
  `AGENTS.md` that tells an AI agent exactly how to satisfy the gate.
- **Azure DevOps support** — CI adapter, PR thread comments, and a pipeline template
  alongside the GitHub Actions path.

### Changed
- **Verdict labels renamed (wording only, behavior byte-for-byte identical):**
  `ESCALATE` → `REVIEW` and `REVISE` → `REWORK`. `APPROVE` is unchanged. This is the
  change `cuspr` and other `@v0`-pinned consumers could not see without a newer tag —
  the motivating case for this release.
- **Renamed the project** proofgate → Plumbline (binary `plumb`, with `proofgate`
  retained as an alias and `.proofgate/` directories read for back-compat).
- **`diff_sha256` binding hardened** — hashes the 3-dot (merge-base) diff over the
  committed HEAD with receipt paths excluded, so it survives GitHub's merge-ref
  checkout and can't be recycled across diffs.

### Notes
- **Migration guard concept.** Migrations (and other protected surfaces) belong in
  `policy.json` `protected_paths` so any change touching them forces
  `self_modifying: true` and routes to human review with no auto-approve path. This is
  a policy convention today, documented for consumers pinning this release.

## [0.1.0]

Initial extraction from the AMOS proof-carrying autonomous loop, released under the
floating `v0` tag: proof-carrying gate for AI agent work — structured receipt, a
deterministic shape check, an LLM semantic review against the repository's mission,
and a failure-capsule rework loop. Single-repo, GitHub Actions + Anthropic API.
